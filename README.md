## What is CeloHT?

CeloHT is a Haitian-led, open-source initiative expanding financial inclusion through three permanent pillars:

1. **[Education](./EDUCATION.md)** — Web3, financial literacy, and digital security education, delivered primarily in Haitian Creole.
2. **[Agent Network](./AGENT_NETWORK.md)** — a trained, community-rooted network of local agents providing cash ↔ cUSD conversion and digital payment support.
3. **[Reforestation](./REFORESTATION.md)** — measurable, transparently reported environmental restoration tied to community development.

CeloHT uses the **Celo blockchain** as infrastructure supporting **cUSD** for payments, **CELO** for gas, and the **Valora** wallet. CeloHT is independently governed by its community and is **not officially affiliated with, endorsed by, or operated by Celo Foundation or Valora.**

**CeloHT has no native token, no ICO, no presale, and makes no investment promises.** See [NO_TOKEN_POLICY.md](./NO_TOKEN_POLICY.md).

## Language Policy

All content in this repository is maintained in **English** as the primary technical/reference language, to ensure consistency for the global developer and partner community. Education-facing materials distributed directly to communities are produced separately, primarily in Haitian Creole — see [EDUCATION.md](./EDUCATION.md#localization).
